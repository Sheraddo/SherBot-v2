# SherBot v2

This is the second version of the SherBot Discord bot. With this new bot, I aim to make this bot more powerful, more organized, and more friendly for others who may wish to use the code I use in this bot.

## Configured the code for your own bot

In this section, I will tell you how you can use this code to set up a working Discord bot.

**Step 1:** Ensure you have Python and the needed modules used to make this bot work installed. (Nextcord, etc.)

**Step 2:** Clone with repository by running: 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Sheraddo/SherBot-v2
```
**Step 3:** Edit the **config.py** file, putting your bot application's token in the set of double quotes

**Step 4:** Run the **main.py** file and everything *should* work

If these steps are flawed in any way, notifying me on Discord would be very much appreciated.
